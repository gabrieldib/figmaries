## Figmaries
_My Figma code reveries_

Figmaries is a collection of portions of code I created for multiple purposes,
sometimes to test an idea before integrating it into a Figma plugin, sometimes just
to perform a quick programmatic operation right there in the sources tab.

Have fun, use this stuff whenever and wherever you want, and please let me know you did.

Cheers, 

Gabriel
